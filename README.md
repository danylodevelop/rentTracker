# rentTracker
- checks imported xlsx/xls bank statement file and matches it to the tenant to check rental payments.
- add tenants to the tenant file
- check tenant info such as property/contact info / rent Amount
- check general bank statement info such as viewo only moneyIn

NOTES:
- Make sure when you import the bank statement as an xls file you clean the format of the file up e.g remove the empty columns that may separate the needed data. (this should only take a few min).
- When you download the xls file from your bank it may come in a html format therefore make sure therefore make sure to Save As the file as an xls/xlsx.

Future additions:
- add dashboard to track overall rent paid each month and check it matches target
- once the rent payment for tenant has been viewed provide a option to upload this data to another xls file
